# Hello-world
Hi everyone, 
I'm here to add some sports related projects and hopefully some of them will be useful for you to check out or use in the near future.
From things like tools to help scrape sports data to betting models, some cool updates should be happening shortly.

I enjoy reading into sports data. Mostly hockey and MMA data for now, but I enjoy international soccer and occasionally other sports as well. I like to work out a lot too and have been focused on powerlifting for the past couple years. That's another area of data I like to read up on, but I have yet to do any work myself. Things like how much training time, muscle mass, fat mass, age, sex etc can influence your expected lifts or what kind of numbers you can expect to see be thrown up at local/regional/state/etc level competitions.

So for now I'll be slowly getting everything set up on here and if anyone has any questions, feel free to contact me here.

Thanks a lot.
